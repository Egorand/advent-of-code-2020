/**
 * --- Day 24: Lobby Layout ---
 *
 * Your raft makes it to the tropical island; it turns out that the small crab was an excellent
 * navigator. You make your way to the resort.
 *
 * As you enter the lobby, you discover a small problem: the floor is being renovated. You can't
 * even reach the check-in desk until they've finished installing the new tile floor.
 *
 * The tiles are all hexagonal; they need to be arranged in a hex grid with a very specific color
 * pattern. Not in the mood to wait, you offer to help figure out the pattern.
 *
 * The tiles are all white on one side and black on the other. They start with the white side
 * facing up. The lobby is large enough to fit whatever pattern might need to appear there.
 *
 * A member of the renovation crew gives you a list of the tiles that need to be flipped over (your
 * puzzle input). Each line in the list identifies a single tile that needs to be flipped by giving
 * a series of steps starting from a reference tile in the very center of the room. (Every line
 * starts from the same reference tile.)
 *
 * Because the tiles are hexagonal, every tile has six neighbors: east, southeast, southwest, west,
 * northwest, and northeast. These directions are given in your list, respectively, as e, se, sw,
 * w, nw, and ne. A tile is identified by a series of these directions with no delimiters; for
 * example, esenee identifies the tile you land on if you start at the reference tile and then move
 * one tile east, one tile southeast, one tile northeast, and one tile east.
 *
 * Each time a tile is identified, it flips from white to black or from black to white. Tiles might
 * be flipped more than once. For example, a line like esew flips a tile immediately adjacent to
 * the reference tile, and a line like nwwswee flips the reference tile itself.
 *
 * Here is a larger example:
 *
 * sesenwnenenewseeswwswswwnenewsewsw
 * neeenesenwnwwswnenewnwwsewnenwseswesw
 * seswneswswsenwwnwse
 * nwnwneseeswswnenewneswwnewseswneseene
 * swweswneswnenwsewnwneneseenw
 * eesenwseswswnenwswnwnwsewwnwsene
 * sewnenenenesenwsewnenwwwse
 * wenwwweseeeweswwwnwwe
 * wsweesenenewnwwnwsenewsenwwsesesenwne
 * neeswseenwwswnwswswnw
 * nenwswwsewswnenenewsenwsenwnesesenew
 * enewnwewneswsewnwswenweswnenwsenwsw
 * sweneswneswneneenwnewenewwneswswnese
 * swwesenesewenwneswnwwneseswwne
 * enesenwswwswneneswsenwnewswseenwsese
 * wnwnesenesenenwwnenwsewesewsesesew
 * nenewswnwewswnenesenwnesewesw
 * eneswnwswnwsenenwnwnwwseeswneewsenese
 * neswnwewnwnwseenwseesewsenwsweewe
 * wseweeenwnesenwwwswnew
 *
 * In the above example, 10 tiles are flipped once (to black), and 5 more are flipped twice (to
 * black, then back to white). After all of these instructions have been followed, a total of 10
 * tiles are black.
 *
 * Go through the renovation crew's list and determine which tiles they need to flip. After all of
 * the instructions have been followed, how many tiles are left with the black side up?
 *
 * --- Part Two ---
 *
 * The tile floor in the lobby is meant to be a living art exhibit. Every day, the tiles are all
 * flipped according to the following rules:
 *
 * - Any black tile with zero or more than 2 black tiles immediately adjacent to it is flipped to
 *   white.
 * - Any white tile with exactly 2 black tiles immediately adjacent to it is flipped to black.
 *
 * Here, tiles immediately adjacent means the six tiles directly touching the tile in question.
 *
 * The rules are applied simultaneously to every tile; put another way, it is first determined
 * which tiles need to be flipped, then they are all flipped at the same time.
 *
 * In the above example, the number of black tiles that are facing up after the given number of
 * days has passed is as follows:
 *
 * Day 1: 15
 * Day 2: 12
 * Day 3: 25
 * Day 4: 14
 * Day 5: 23
 * Day 6: 28
 * Day 7: 41
 * Day 8: 37
 * Day 9: 49
 * Day 10: 37
 *
 * Day 20: 132
 * Day 30: 259
 * Day 40: 406
 * Day 50: 566
 * Day 60: 788
 * Day 70: 1106
 * Day 80: 1373
 * Day 90: 1844
 * Day 100: 2208
 *
 * After executing this process a total of 100 times, there would be 2208 black tiles facing up.
 *
 * How many tiles will be black after 100 days?
